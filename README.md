# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Google-Play-Reviews
Sentiment analysis on Google Play reviews for 12 retailing companies.

With the development of e-commerce, many customers are migrating to online shopping from local stores. Online retailers have to develop user-friendly applications to attract more consumers. When evaluating the application, customer reviews are essential to show the strength and weaknesses of an app. The scores of comments are the most straightforward method of evaluation, but they can only present one dimension. However, sentiment analysis can identify if the text indicates an underlying sentiment and help understand customer feedback. 

We extracted 11112 reviews of 12 online shopping apps on Google Play from 19/11/2016 to 5/4/2022. In this paper, we aim to analyse the customersâ€™ sentiment behind the scores of reviews for different online retailing apps, find out the important features of high-rank and low-rank apps and provide valuable advice for SHEIN.
